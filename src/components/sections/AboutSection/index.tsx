			<p>I&apos;m a gal living it up in the Greater Seattle Area enjoying greenery and rain. I started a position as a software engineer at Blue Origin on May 4, 2020, where I am developing a killer web app that manages high-performance computing jobs on AWS. <Emoji symbol="ðŸš€" label="rocket" /><Emoji symbol="ðŸŒŒ" label="galaxy" /></p>
			<p>Recently, I&apos;ve also stepped up my game on working on my side projects, but I would love a focus week to finish the Rocketry.js rewrite to TypeScript.</p>
